# Lemmatization versus Stemming

- **Lemmatization**: grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)]
- **Stemming**: reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)]

Unlike stemming, lemmatization depends on correctly identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence, as well as within the larger context surrounding that sentence, such as neighboring sentences or even an entire document.

The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root

conflation := treating words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion in search algorithms and engines
