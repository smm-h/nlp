# Inflection versus Derivation

- **inflection**: affixation that preserves lemma
- **derivation**: affixation that does not preserve lemma

---

- an inflectional morpheme does not change the lexical categories of words
- a derivational morpheme does

---

- inflection: fast (adj) + -er = faster (adj)
- derivation: teach (v) + -er = teacher (n)

---

- inflectional: indicating how a certain word relates to other words in a larger phrase
- derivational: changing either the part of speech or the actual meaning of a word
