# Coarticulation

- [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarticulation)]
- an isolated phoneme is influenced by, and becomes more like, a preceding or following one
- a phoneme influences another to produce an allophonic variation, such as vowels becoming nasalized before nasal consonants (/n, m, ŋ/) when the soft palate (velum) opens prematurely or /b/ becoming labialized as in "boot" [bʷuːt̚] or "ball" [bʷɔːɫ] in some accents. This article describes both processes under the term assimilation.

There are two types of coarticulation:

- anticipatory: when a feature of a phoneme is anticipated (assumed) during the production of its preceding one
- carryover or perseverative: when the effects of a phoneme are seen during the production of sound(s) that follow

Many models have been developed to account for coarticulation. They include the look-ahead, articulatory syllable, time-locked, window, coproduction and articulatory phonology models.

Coarticulation in phonetics refers to two different phenomena:

- the assimilation of the place of articulation of one speech sound to that of an adjacent speech sound. For example, while the sound /n/ of English normally has an alveolar place of articulation, in the word tenth it is pronounced with a dental place of articulation because the following sound, /θ/, is dental.
- the production of a co-articulated consonant, that is, a consonant with two simultaneous places of articulation. An example of such a sound is the voiceless labial-velar plosive /k͡p/ found in many West African languages.
  
The term coarticulation may also refer to the transition from one articulatory gesture to another.
