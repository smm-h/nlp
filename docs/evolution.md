# Evolution of Languages

The evolution of even a single natural language is a highly divergent phenomenon, as a great number of independent minds use it. Different dialects, type systems, fonts, glyphs, variants, registers, etc., all exist simply because more than one person uses a language. Therefore to pass the test of time it requires periodic attempts of reunification.

## Proto-speaking: Short-lived understanding

The first speaking systems were unstructured and included only very simple utterences and almost no rules of grammar or writing. Hence they would vanish in the blink of an eye, relative to the history of language. Any civilization or tribe that did not record its culture permanantly through writing was forgotten.

People needed to use body language, gestures, and the occassional utterences to convey a very primitive form of meaning. It probably did not have aspects such as past or future. People literally lived in the present.

The immediate goal in such systems were for one person to understand another. It was highly unlikely for many people to understand each other, and therefore the only proto-societes were small tribes with brittle interrelations.

## Proto-writing: Long-lived misunderstanding

The first writing systems used ideographs to convey meaning; but as it is obvious to us today, graphemes that do not correspond to phonemes cannot be accurately repronounced, and are subject to subjective interpretation, and thus were poorly equiped to carry meaning. Misunderstandings arisen from these conventions lead to the alphabetic principle.

People needed recognize highly detailed graphic symbols and associate them with previously taught meanings. Ideagraphs represented only content words or full-on events so grammar was still not present.

The immediate goal in such systems were to unite and control many people using symbolic identity and loyalty. Flags appeared during this era. Ideographs, carved in wood or stone, were used to symbolize the longevity of a civilization. Abstract thinking originated here, with symbols being open to interpretation. Religion originated here.

## Languages with both speaking and writing

The alphabetic principle, as it is known today, is when speaking and writing collide, co-exist and eventually correspond. Such systems in which units of speech and writing, known as phonemes and graphemes corresponded, formed actual languages and allowed its users to read, write, and convey meaning in the least misunderstood way possible.

People needed to abstract away a person's voice to discern an utterence, abstract away a person's handwriting to discern a pattern, break down utterences to phonemes and graphic patterns to graphemes, associate graphemes with phoenems and vice-versa, and reproduce those graphemes and phonemes.

### Birth of Structured Societies

Though people could reproduce speech and writing, they still had to interpret what they heard or saw to reproduce meaning. This could still lead to misunderstanding, thus structured societies were formed, in which authorities, often the elderly, decided on what things meant. They also settled disputes. Collectively, the enitre structure formed a unified mind that acquired new words and their meaning. Attempts were made to flatten the deep connotational associations into denotations. Authorities acted as live dictionaries for the language of the group.

### Strive towards Literacy

Though many could reproduce speech, few could reproduce writing. Millenia of education has been an effort to use language-authorities to trans
