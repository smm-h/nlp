# Denotation and Connotation

Any given word or phrase carries:

- **Denotations**, which are its explicit, primary, or literal meanings, and
- **Connotations**, which are its cultural or emotional associations commonly understood.

Connotations may be positive, negative, or both; e.g. "stubborn" **connotates** both "difficult" (negative) and "willful" (positive).

Denotation is the surface or the literal meaning. It is the definition most likely to appear in a dictionary.

A second level of meanings is termed connotative. These meanings are not objective representations of the thing, but new usages produced by the language group.
