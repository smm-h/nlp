# Alphabetic principle

- single or compound graphemes originated as visualizations of single phonemes

Q: why do, when broken down, written units not correspond with equivalent spoken unit?

A: a fully phonemic spelling is an ideal that most orthographies only approximate because:

- over time, pronunciation evolves much faster than spelling
- the spoken form of words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system
- different meanings of a word or homophones may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually
