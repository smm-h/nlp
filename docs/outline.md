# Outline

## `Session`

- a `Session` stores anything "understood"
- a `Session` can open many files and load them into RAM as `Resource`s
- the state of a `Session` can be stored in a file and later loaded back into RAM to save progress, as it is computationally expensive

## `Decision`

- from its birth, every `Session` makes a great many `Decision`s to forge its "mind" and `Idea`s
- every `Decision` affects manys things
- every `Decision` must be reversible, and when reversed, its effects must completely vanish without a trace
- tough decisions may enter a queue and await user intervention
- the answer to a decision may be gray, not b/w

## `Document`

- a `Resource` may generate one or more `Documents`
- a `Document` is a `Tree` of `Idea`
- a `Document` is an `Idea` itself, so a document may have more documents as children

## `Idea`
