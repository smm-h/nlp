# Emics and Etics

[[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_unit)]

An emic is the invariant form we get when we reduce a class of variant forms to a limited number of abstract units. The variant forms are called etics.

A given emic underlies many different observable "surface" representations, called etics.

- **Phoneme**: the emics to the etics of phones
- **Grapheme**: the emics to the etics of glyphs
- **Morpheme**: meaningful fragments of language / a morphological unit
- **Lexeme**: a lexical unit
- **Grammeme**: a unit of grammar / a value of a grammatical category
- **Chereme**: a unit in sign languages
- **Sememe**: a unit of meaning, expressed by a morpheme or not, e.g. plurality for _-s_
- **Tagmeme**: smallest functional element in the grammatical structure of a language
- **Meme**: cultural ideas, symbols, or practices
- **Mytheme**: basic narratological/mythological unit
- **Narreme**: basic narratological unit

## Accounts

- an **emic account** requires the knowledge of an **insider**
- an **etic account** is the observations of an **outsider**

An etic units that represent a given emic unit is prefixed by allo- which means "other", such as allophone, as in these phonetics are allophones of this phonemic.
