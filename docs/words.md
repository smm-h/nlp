# Words

A word is a meaningful unit of a language that can stand on its own, and is made up of [morphemes](morpheme.md).

- [how it is spelled and how it is pronounced](spelling-vs-pronunciation.md)
- what it [means](meaning.md)
- how it is formed (formation) and how it *was* formed (origin)

a word, by definition, always [stands alone](bound-vs-free-morphemes.md)

words are either [content words or functions words](content-versus-function-words.md)
