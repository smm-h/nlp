# Analytic versus Synthetic Languages

- **analytic**: since it uses few bound morphemes, it expresses most grammatical relationships by word order or helper words; uses little or no inflection to indicate grammatical relationships
- **synthetic**: it uses a substantial number of bound morphemes to express grammatical relationships; words often consist of multiple morphemes

## Isolating language

- a very low morpheme per word ratio ($\approx 1$); i.e. each word contains a single morpheme
- no inflectional morphology whatsoever

## Analytic language

To convey grammatical information and relationships between words in sentences, they rely heavily on:

- helper words
  - particles
  - prepositions
  - postpositions
  - modifiers
  - definite and indefinite articles (which tend to be less prominently used or absent in strongly synthetic languages)
  - auxiliary verbs
- strict word order
- context

as opposed to using inflections (changing the form of a word to convey its role in the sentence)

## Synthetic language

- uses inflection or agglutination to express syntactic relationships within a sentence
  - inflection is the addition of morphemes to a root word that assigns grammatical property to that word
  - agglutination is the combination of two or more morphemes into one word
- The information added by morphemes can include indications of a word's grammatical category, such as whether a word is the subject or object in the sentence
- Morphology can be either relational or derivational

Subtypes based on how the morphemes are combined:

- fusional
- agglutinative
- polysynthetic
- oligosynthetic
