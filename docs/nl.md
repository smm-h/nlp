# NL

a word := how it is spelled, how it is pronounced

"to pronounce" := to generate an array of phonemes from a given array of graphemes
"to spell" := to generate an array of graphemes from a given array of phonemes

"Alphabetic principle" := single or compound graphemes originated as visualizations of single phonemes

Q: why do, when broken down, written units not correspond with equivalent spoken unit?

A: a fully phonemic spelling is an ideal that most orthographies only approximate because

- over time, pronunciation evolves much faster than spelling
- the spoken form of words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system
- different meanings of a word or homophones may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually

pronunciation: the way in which a mind converts a word is into a sequence of sounds

- cultural exposure during childhood
- residence
- speech or voice disorders
- ethnic group
- social class
- education

vocabulary: the set of words known by a mind, within a language, developed the age
syntax
semantics

orthography – written form
phonology – spoken form
register – appropriacy of use or register
collocation – lexical neighbours
word associations
