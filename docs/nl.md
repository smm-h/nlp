children, with UG already in them, adopt syntactic rules that conform to it as they grow and develop.

rules must be definite, coherent, non-technical, cumulative and heuristic

as the rules accumulate, an axiomatic system is formed between the two languages that enables a speaker of the first to learn the second

prescriptive linguistics: a lossy attempt to formalize an informal language
descriptive linguistics: to study the subjective elements lost during formalization

a word := how it is spelled, how it is pronounced

"to pronounce" := to generate an array of phonemes from a given array of graphemes
"to spell" := to generate an array of graphemes from a given array of phonemes

"Alphabetic principle" := single or compound graphemes originated as visualizations of single phonemes

Q: why do, when broken down, written units not correspond with equivalent spoken unit?

A: a fully phonemic spelling is an ideal that most orthographies only approximate because

- over time, pronunciation evolves much faster than spelling
- the spoken form of words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system
- different meanings of a word or homophones may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually

pronunciation: the way in which a mind converts a word is into a sequence of sounds

- cultural exposure during childhood
- residence
- speech or voice disorders
- ethnic group
- social class
- education

vocabulary: the set of words known by a mind, within a language, developed the age
syntax
semantics

orthography – written form
phonology – spoken form
semantics – concept, reference, meaning
register – appropriacy of use or register
collocation – lexical neighbours
word associations
syntax – grammatical function
morphology – word parts

syllable = c + v + c = onset + nucleus + coda

- proto-writing: ideas are encoded in ideographs, words are avoided, it is impossible to reconstruct the original meaning
- writing := utterance is encoded in syllables so that another reader can reconstruct the utterance
- ideograph := a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases. Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention
- pictograph := an ideograph that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object
