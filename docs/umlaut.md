# Umlaut

- [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(linguistics))]
- a form of [assimilation](assimilation.md)
- a vowel being pronounced more like **a following vowel or semivowel**
- essentially the same as regressive metaphony
- literally "sound alteration" in German
- most common in Germanic languages

If a word has two vowels, one far back in the mouth and the other far forward, it takes more effort to pronounce. If the vowels were closer together, it would take less effort. Thus, one way the language may change is that these two vowels get drawn closer together.

The most commonly seen types of umlaut are the following:

Vowel raising, triggered by a following high vowel (often specifically a high front vowel such as /i/).
Vowel fronting, triggered by a following front vowel (often specifically a high front vowel such as /i/).
Vowel lowering, triggered by a following non-high vowel (often specifically a low vowel such as /a/).
Vowel rounding, triggered by a following rounded vowel (often specifically a high rounded vowel such as /u/).
These processes may be named by the vowel that triggers the change (for example, i-mutation, a-mutation, u-mutation, sometimes known as i-umlaut, a-umlaut, u-umlaut). However, processes named in this fashion may not have consistent meanings across language families.

All of these processes occurred in the history of the Germanic languages; see Germanic umlaut for more details. I-mutation is the most prominent of the processes, to the extent that it is often referred to simply as "umlaut".

Similar processes also occurred in the history of the Celtic languages, especially Old Irish. In this context, these processes are often referred to as affection.

Vowel-raising umlaut occurred in the history of many of the Romance languages, in which it is normally termed metaphony.

The umlaut vowel diacritic (two dots side-by-side above a vowel) was originally used to indicate vowels affected by Germanic umlaut.
