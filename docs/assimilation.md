- a phonological process
- language-agnostic
- a sound change in which some phonemes (typically consonants or vowels) change to become more similar to other nearby sounds
- either within a word or between words
- may be synchronic or diachronic
- see also [coarticulation](coarticulation.md)

## In-depth

- more common in more rapid speech
- causes the sound to differ from the in-isolation pronunciation
- phonemes typically assimilate to the next one, but they may also assimilate to a preceding one
- assimilation most commonly occurs between immediately adjacent-sounds but may occur between sounds that are separated by others

## Examples

- input, or anything prefixed with _in-_, pronounced with phonetic [m] rather than [n]
  - implant historically composed of in + plant
- "handbag" (/ˈhændbæɡ/) pronounced /ˈhæmbæɡ/ in rapid speech because the [m] and [b] sounds are both bilabial consonants, and their places of articulation are similar. However, the sequence [d]-[b] has different places but similar manner of articulation (voiced stop) and is sometimes elided, which sometimes causes the canonical [n] phoneme to assimilate to [m] before the [b]. The pronunciations /ˈhænbæɡ/ or /ˈhændbæɡ/ are, however, common in normal speech
- "cupboard", although historically a compound of "cup" /kʌp/ and "board" /bɔːrd/, it is always pronounced /ˈkʌbərd/, never */ˈkʌpbɔːrd/, even in slow, highly-articulated speech
