## Syntax versus Semantics

Our goal is to take syntax as input, interpret it to generate its semantics, and return that as output.

|                | Syntax           | Semantics        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Structure      | Linear           | Hierarchical     |
| Implementation | `List<Grapheme>` | `Tree<Morpheme>` |

## Formation of individual words

Lexicosemantics :=

- the meanings of words
- how words structure their meaning
- how word act in when [compositionality](compositionality.md)
- the relationships between the distinct senses and uses of a word

The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. Lexical units include the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon. Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax. This is referred to as syntax-semantics interface.[3]

The study of lexical semantics looks at:

the classification and decomposition of lexical items
the differences and similarities in lexical semantic structure cross-linguistically
the relationship of lexical meaning to sentence meaning and syntax.
Lexical units, also referred to as syntactic atoms, can stand alone such as in the case of root words or parts of compound words or they necessarily attach to other units such as prefixes and suffixes do. The former are called free morphemes and the latter bound morphemes.[4] They fall into a narrow range of meanings (semantic fields) and can combine with each other to generate new denotations.

Cognitive semantics is the linguistic paradigm/framework that since the 1980s has generated the most studies in lexical semantics, introducing innovations like prototype theory, conceptual metaphors, and frame semantics.[5]

The formation of a word, or [صرف](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%81), studies the structure of a individual words.

A word has no space within, "smallest meaningful unit of a language"

- Borrowed/Loaned
- Derivation/Inflection
- `Inflector`, a pattern of letters with a certain implication
  - `Affix`
    - `Prefix`
    - `Suffix`
- [`Lexeme`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme), denoted by its [lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)), or "headword"
- `Connector`, a pattern of words with a certain implication
  - Article

## Formation of collections of words

Formation of words, or [نحو](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88) studies the relation between words that constitue a word-groups.

- Phrase
- Sentence
