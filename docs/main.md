## Syntax versus Semantics

Our goal is to take syntax as input, interpret it to generate its semantics, and return that as output.

|                | Syntax           | Semantics        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Structure      | Linear           | Hierarchical     |
| Implementation | `List<Grapheme>` | `Tree<Morpheme>` |

## Formation of individual words

Lexicosemantics :=

- the meanings of words
- how words structure their meaning
- how word act in [compositionality](compositionality.md)
- the relationships between the distinct senses and uses of a word

Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the [lexical units](lexical-item.md) correlates with the structure of the language or syntax.

The formation of a word, or [صرف](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%81), studies the structure of a individual words.

A word has no space within, "smallest meaningful unit of a language"

- `Connector`, a pattern of words with a certain implication

## Formation of collections of words
