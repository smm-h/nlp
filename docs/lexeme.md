# Lexeme

a units of meaning that corresponds to a set of related forms of a word, often through inflection, regular or irregular

it underlies a set of forms derived from a root morpheme

## Root morpheme

- language-agnostic
- a.k.a. root, root-word, core, base, lemma, headword, citation form
- irreducible into more meaningful elements
- primary lexical unit of a word and a word family
- carries aspects of semantic content
- cannot be reduced into smaller constituents
- Roots can be either [free morphemes or bound morphemes](bound-vs-free-morphemes.md)
  - free: examin- in examination
  - bound: socio- in sociology
- the building blocks for [affixation](affixation.md) and compounds
- in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term "root" is generally synonymous with "free morpheme"

Many such languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word
