- [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme)]
- [a unit of lexical meaning](lexical-item.md) that underlies a set of [words](words.md) that are related through [inflection](inflection-vs-derivation.md), regular or irregular
- roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single [root word](root.md)
- one form, [the lemma](root.md), is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme
