# Content versus Function words

- **lexical items** or **content words**: carry specific lexical meaning
  - nouns (words representing things)
  - verbs (words representing actions)
- **grammatical items** or **function words**: carry little or no lexical meaning and serve to express grammatical relationships between the different words
  - affixes
  - prepositions
  - auxiliaries
  - case markers
  - inflections
  - sentence connectives

## Grammaticalization

a process during which lexical items become grammatical items "to serve grammatical functions, and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions"

Examples include *will* and *let's*
