# Bound versus Free Morphemes

- **bound**: a morpheme that can only appear as part of a larger expression / it does not occur in isolation / it cannot appear alone; e.g. "-al" in "factual".
- **free** or unbound: one that can appear alone; e.g. "fact" in "factual".

## Empty morpheme

A special type of bound morpheme with no inherent meaning; they change the phonetics of a word but offer no semantic value to the word as a whole; e.g. "-u-" in "factual".
