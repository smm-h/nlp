# Spelling versus Pronunciation

- **to pronounce**: to generate an array of [phonemes](phoneme.md) from a given array of [graphemes](grapheme.md)
- **to spell**: to generate an array of graphemes from a given array of phonemes

Pronunciation is affected by:

- cultural exposure during childhood
- residence
- speech or voice disorders
- ethnic group
- social class
- education
