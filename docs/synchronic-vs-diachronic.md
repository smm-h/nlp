# Synchronic versus Diachronic

- **Synchronic**: active at a given point in time / considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account
- **Diachronic**: historical evolution of languages / considers the development and evolution of a language through history / change over time
  - to describe and account for observed changes in particular languages
  - to reconstruct the pre-history of languages and to determine their relatedness, grouping them into language families (comparative linguistics)
  - general theories about how and why language changes
  - history of speech communities
  - history of words, i.e. etymology

> Unless we can demonstrate significant changes in the conditions of language acquisition and use between some time in the unobservable past and the present, we must assume that the same types and distributions of structures, variation, changes, etc. existed at that time in the past as in the present.
> $-$ Donald Ringe

- acquisition: nativity, in early childhood
- usage: to transmit information, to express solidarity with family, friends, and neighbors, to mark one's social position, etc.
- general structure and organization
- ways in which it changes
