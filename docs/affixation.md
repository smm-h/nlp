# Affixation

- a morphological process
- affixes are [bound](bound-vs-free-morphemes.md) by definition

## Types

- `Continuous` phonetic components are sequential within a word
  - `Prefix` (ax) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix)]
  - `Suffix` (xa) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix)]
  - `Circumfix` (axa) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumfix)]
  - `Interfix` (x-_a_-y) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfix)]
  - `Infix` (xax) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix#English)]
  - `Tmesis` (x-_bloody_-x) [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmesis)]
- `Discontinuous` phonetic components are spread out between or around the phones that comprise the root [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonconcatenative_morphology)]
  - `Transfix` (x broken down, and applied to a pattern)
- `Duplifix` root is slightly changed and duplicated [[w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication)]
  - Exact (x x)
  - Contrastive focus (_x_ x)
  - Shm (x shm-x)
  - Rhyming (x mex)
  - Ablaut (ex ax, vowel change)
